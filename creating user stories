single Resource in this app called a Review so that we 
have something to CRUD
A Resource is an abstract object that we use to organize data, code, 
and the features of our app. 
For example, a User resource we can keep track of 
logging in and out, email and passwords, and people's birthdays. 
In a blog, we might have an Article or Post resource where we 
would track the titles and bodies of articles and keep 
track of the code for publishing and sharing them.
